# About
Doctran is a cross-platform documentation generator for the Fortran programming language. It's purpose is to take free-format Fortran files, and produce a collection of html files documenting their contents. 

On this GitHub page you will find the open source base component of Doctran. The available plugins allowing one to document Fortran constructs  are currently proprietary and are available [here](http://www.doctran.co.uk/pages/download).

#Aims
The ultimate aim of this project is to create robust software for creating documentation for the Fortran language, that eventually will be open-source. At the present time, the base code is open source and freely available here on Gibhub.

#Plugins
Plugins for Doctran will be initially released as proprietary, but open sourced once a funding target is achieved. A plugin enabling Doctran to document Fortran 95 code is available from Doctran's [homepage](http://www.doctran.co.uk).

#Examples
Examples of documentation generated from Doctran can be found [here](http://www.doctran.co.uk/pages/examples). These examples show Doctran running with the Fortran 95 plugin.
