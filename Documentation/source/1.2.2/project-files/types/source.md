# Source
Specifies a path to Fortran source files. This can be specified multiple times and takes the following form:

    Source: PATH

This can be used instead of or in conjunction with specifying source files at the command-line.

`PATH` can be more complex than a single filename. See [PATH](project-files/values/path.md) for more details.
