### What's new in Doctran 1.2.2

 * The style of the generated documentation has been modified to take advantage of wide screen and high resolution displays.
 * `Menu` project information element added, to allow menu customizations. The menu is now generated from a markdown or HTML file containing macros.
 * `UserPage` project information element added, so that additional documentation pages can be created from the user's markdown or HTML files.
 * `Source` project information element added so that source files can be specified from the project file. 
 * `Tagline` project information element added, which should not be used to specify the project's tagline.
 * A project page is no longer automatically generated from comments within the project file, instead this can be created using the `UserPage` information element.
 * Headings in meta-data have moved one level up, so the top level heading used in descriptions is now `<h2>` or `##`.
