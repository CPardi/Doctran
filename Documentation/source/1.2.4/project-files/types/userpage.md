# UserPage
Specifies that a non-source file should be included within the generated documentation. This can be specified multiple times and takes the following form:

    UserPage: PATH
    
where `PATH` is the path to a user page file. The pages generated from this content will contain a header and menu similar to automatically generated pages.

See [here](user-page-files.md) for more information on user page files.

`PATH` can be more complex than a single filename and specify multiple user page files. See [PATH](project-files/values/path.md) for more details.
